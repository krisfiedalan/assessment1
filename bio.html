<p>Hello, I'm Kristina Fiedalan, an international student hailing from the Philippines, currently pursuing a Master of Information Technology in the vibrant city of Sydney, Australia. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology back in the Philippines. Besides my dedication to studies, I have a passion for exploring new places, hiking scenic trails, and experimenting with exciting recipes. Juggling work and studies, my time in Australia has not only enriched my educational experience but has also connected me with incredible individuals and imparted valuable life lessons.</p>
<p>In the past, I worked as an analyst handling customer, vendor, and material master data for two leading companies in the food and beverage industry. Throughout this role, I enhanced my expertise in establishing master data, implementing pricing structures, overseeing trade promotions, and maintaining compliance with organizational protocols. Afterward, I worked for five years as an Order Fulfillment Specialist at a prominent software and technology corporation. During this position, my duties encompassed verifying and arranging customer orders, handling modifications and cancellations, and consistently keeping customers informed about shipment and order statuses.</p>
<p>Through continuous learning and participation in projects aimed at improving processes, I have gained proficiency in tools such as SharePoint, Power Automate, and Power Apps. I have been recognized for my substantial contributions to these endeavors. My professional journey has been characterized by commitment, adaptability, and a dedication to ongoing enhancement - qualities that I also bring to my academic endeavors and beyond.</p>
