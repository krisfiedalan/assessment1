<p>Sydney is a city known for its beautiful waterfront with two famous structures that represent its lively atmosphere—the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. The Opera House, located at Circular Quay, is a stunning example of modern architecture designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon. At sunset, the Opera House becomes even more magical as its sails are illuminated in golden light, capturing the awe of spectators. Right next to this famous architectural landmark is the Sydney Harbour Bridge, often called the "Coathanger." Linking the north and south shores of Sydney, it's not just a means of transportation but also an exciting experience. If you're looking for some adventure, you can even climb the bridge and enjoy breathtaking views of the city. And as night falls, the bridge lights up beautifully, capturing the vibrant energy of Sydney after sunset.</p>
